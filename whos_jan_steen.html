</head>

    <h1>Ever heard of Rembrandt or Vermeer? Get ready to meet their Hilarious Pal, Jan Steen!</h1>

    <p>Are you a lover of Dutch art? Do Rembrandt's dramatic shadows or Vermeer's serene light speak to you? Well, get ready to add a new name to your list: Jan Steen (around 1626-1679). Think of him as the artist who brought the party to the Dutch Golden Age, and who also loved to pop up in his own painted worlds!</p>

    <h2>What Makes Jan Steen Stand Out?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Right in the Golden Age Mix: Just like those famous guys, Steen was painting during this incredible period of Dutch art.</li>
        <li>The Master of the Merry Mess: While others were painting serious portraits or calm interiors, Steen was capturing real moments of everyday life. Think lively taverns, families in a bit of a kerfuffle.</li>
        <li>The Fun Game of "Spot the Artist!": Here's a cool thing about Jan Steen – he loved to sneak himself into his own paintings! Keep an eye out for a jovial-looking fellow who pops up in various roles.</li>
        <li>More Than Just Giggles: His paintings are definitely entertaining, but they often have a little something extra. Sometimes he's hinting at a moral or making a funny nod to a popular saying. Pretty clever!</li>
        <li>An Innkeeper Artist? Cool, Right? Believe it or not, Steen apparently ran an inn for a while. Talk about prime people-watching for an artist! You can almost see where he got some of his wild ideas.</li>
        <li>Seriously Talented Painter: Don't let the funny scenes fool you – Steen was a really skilled artist. He knew how to paint light, expressions, and all those little details that make his paintings so engaging.</li>
    </ul>
